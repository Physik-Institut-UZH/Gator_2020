The bulk composition of the Rotondo granite is primarily quartz (25 %–35 % by volume), alkali feldspar (microcline) (20 %–40 %), plagioclase (albite and oligoclase)
(10 %–25 %) and biotite (3 %–8 %) (Hafner, 1958; Labhart,
2005). At some locations, trace amounts of mica, chlorite and
garnet are encountered.
